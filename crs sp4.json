        "2. Course Description": "of Biological Sciences organizes lectures and workshops throughout the semester. These lectures include an introductory meeting with students on the definition and objectives of the graduation project course, and workshops help to understand the construction of the scientific database, literature survey, and the main concepts of writing a scientific report. Students are encouraged to work in groups. Each group chooses a subject for their graduation project and works under the supervision of a professor. The graduation projects are experimental practical research. Finally, students are required to submit a graduation report and present it scientifically.",

        "5. Course Main Objectives": "The graduation research project aims to provide students with higher skills that are expected from the graduates of the biological sciences department and are required in the working and research fields after graduation, those skills are: Preparing students for the scientific research by introducing them to its tools and providing the learner with the skills of formulating hypotheses and designing methods for testing this hypothesis. The ability to conduct a scientific experiment, collect, analyze, and interpret data. Working in a group and learning effective communication.",
